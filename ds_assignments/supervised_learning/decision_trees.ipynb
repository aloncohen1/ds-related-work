When using the tree to predict on our sample data, each sample will go to a different leaf and will be predicted correctly, acheiving an error of 0 (this can be acheived with an id3 tree if the first feature is removed).

    "## Discussion\n",
    "In this question we formed two classifiers - random forest & decision tree and we test thier performnce for the MNIST data set.<br> First we tried to find the optimal dataset size & test size by testing the accuracy_score for different dataset & test sizes.<br> \n",
    "<tab>    Note: At this point we must say accuracy_score is just one metric to evaluate a model performance.<br> We might choose different hyperparameters for a different evaluations metrics.\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "Next, we tried to find the optimal hyperparameters by using grid search method. after applying this methods we couldn't acheive better performance compared to the default parameters. We would still prefer the model with the optimal parameters from the gridsearch, because it will likely generalise better than the default.\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "We then plotted the pixels importance for both of our models. as we expected, there is a bias toward the center of each pixels row, which can be seen in the plots as many \"mini normal distributions\".<br>\n",
    "We also noticed there center rows of pixels are more important, which translated to a general \"normal distribution\" in the two plots.<br>  \n",
    "Lastly, we presented the confusion matrix for the two models. The most common mistake in both models was classifying 4 as 9, which make sense given the digits shapes."
